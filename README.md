### Jonxhikari -- A discord bot written in python with the help of Hikari, Lightbulb, and Tanjun.
> This project is not intended to be used in production.
> The source is available for anyone who is trying to learn to utilize Hikari.

Not many people know about this library yet, so finding information is tough sometimes. This library
has it's own way of doing things but it's been a blast to learn!

Command handlers are not built into Hikari itself, instead allowing you the freedom to choose your own.
I have implemented 2 separate command handlers in this bot as a demonstration. Tanjun for slash commands,
and Lightbulb for regular commands. You can use either one, or create your own!

Check out the projects if curious how to get started!
