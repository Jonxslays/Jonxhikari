### Jonxhikari -- Discord bot written in python with Hikari.
> This project is not intended to be used in production.
> The source is available for anyone who is trying to learn Hikari.

- This bots design is heavily influenced by [Carberretta](https://github.com/Carberra/Carberretta).
- Not many people know about this library yet, so getting the information out there will help us all learn.
- Check out the [Hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari) project if you're interested in trying it out!
