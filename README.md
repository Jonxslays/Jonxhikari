### Jonxhikari -- A discord bot written in python with the help of Hikari, Lightbulb, and Tanjun.
> This project is not intended to be used in production.
> The source is available for anyone who is trying to learn to utilize Hikari.

This bot is now sorely out of date.
For an up-to-date and maintained example see [Starr](https://github.com/Jonxslays/Starr).

Not many people know about this library yet, so finding information is tough sometimes. This library
has it's own way of doing things but it's been a blast to learn!

Command handlers are not built into Hikari itself, instead allowing you the freedom to choose your own.
I have implemented 2 separate command handlers in this bot as a demonstration. Tanjun for slash commands,
and Lightbulb for regular commands. You can use either one, or create your own!
